// This is an incomplete list of modules which don't have TypeScript types yet.
// They help to keep the compiler happy when using noImplicitAny.
// It would be better to have proper declarations, better still to get them from definitelytyped.org.
// Please keep this list sorted alphabetically:
declare module 'react-textarea-autosize'
